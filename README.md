# Central Perk

Central Perk is a web application inspired by the iconic TV show "Friends." In a world where dating apps dominate, we believe that true companionship and genuine friendships are equally important. Central Perk aims to provide a platform where lonely individuals can connect with like-minded people and find meaningful friendships.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Upon visiting the web app, users are greeted with a welcoming landing page. They can then proceed to sign up for an account. If they have already registered, they can log in to their existing account.

- **Finding Friends**: Once logged in, users are presented with a list of potential friends. They can view the profiles of these individuals and send friend requests. If the request is accepted, the app automatically initiates a conversation between them.

- **Group Chats**: Users can create group chats, allowing them to connect with multiple friends simultaneously. This feature promotes a sense of community and encourages users to expand their social circles.

- **Keep the Conversation Going**: To avoid awkward silences, Central Perk offers a game of truth or dare. Users can play this game with their friends, making conversations more engaging and lively.

## Technologies Used

Central Perk utilizes ReactJS for the frontend development and Express for the backend implementation. This combination provides a robust and interactive user experience.

## Contribution

- **Gedion**: Responsible for designing the pages related to group chat and the normal chatting interface.
